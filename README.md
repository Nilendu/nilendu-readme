<b> Things that bring out my best </b>


1. 	Data-driven, contextual interactions - e.g., “I have 8 developers, 2 of them are on leave for 4 weeks. I have 82 tickets. PM wants me to ship by July. How can you help me?”, rather than “I need to hire more devs”

2. 	Fast, Minimalist Software  - doing less, delivering on time; Speed of page load/code; Lots of whitespaces like Medium.com

3. 	Great hires – smart and energetic who we could highly recommend to just about every team/any company, but we – selfishly – won’t!

4. 	Constructive Dissent  - Please tell me your solution as well; Attack process, not people; Blame less, own more. Do.


<b> Things that bring out my worst </b>


1. 	Repeated Outages, Incidents, Customer Escalations - it is a clear sign that as artists we are "not signing our work". We are just not proud of what we are shipping.

2. 	Cost - I am naturally frugal. Perhaps spend more time than needed on just about any line items with $ in it. e.g., (software) cost/unit of product is the single most "meta" metric I track.

3. 	Not following through - I am working to be more process-oriented. e.g., I do not always write-down ask from others, and implicitly assume you’re agreeing. When it’s not there in a few days, I lose a bit of trust in you. Entirely my own to fix!

4. 	Shiny, new technology just for resume building or just for the heck of coolness. Also, because too much code is too many bugs.
